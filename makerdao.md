## MakerDAO

##

~~affiliated~~

- [geoplex.de](https://geoplex.de) - 2D/3D GIS
- [syncrypt.space](https://syncrypt.space) - Encrypted cloud storage

## Short history

- Bitcoin (2008)
- Ethereum mainnet launch (2015)
- The DAO (2016)
- Already in 2014: MakerDAO was founded by Rune Christensen

## Back then

- A company "founded in a chat room" / No jurisdiction
- No ICO
    - Private sales to friends, family and investors
    - Goal: Responsible token holders as owners
- First MakerDAO owner token issued on Bitshares

## Nowadays

- Moved to Ethereum: MKR is an ERC20 token
- Distributed: 100 Employees in ~30 Cities
- [Investment since 2017 ~$27M, Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital and others](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/makerdao#section-funding-rounds)
- MakerDAO Foundation registered several legal companies

## Stable coins

##

"You need stablecoins to realize the full potential of blockchain technology."

## Why?

- Augur bet in 6 months
- ICO participation (both sides)
- Remittances
- etc.

<p class="fragment">â†’ Majority of use cases *require* a stable coin.</p>

## Basic requirements

- Pegged to a reference value ($, â‚¬, IMF SDR, ...)
- Backed by something to assert value

## Risks

- Risk #1: Irrational market <span style="color: orange;">ðŸ™ƒ</span>
- Risk #2: Counter Party / Collateral <span style="color: orange;">ðŸ˜•</span>

## One Solution

*Fiat-backed stablecoins* are IOU tokens and are usually backed by a bank
balance.

## Examples

<div class="container">

<div>

* Tether (USDT, 2.000 Mio US$)
* USD-C (Circle/Coinbase, 239 Mio US$)
* TrueUSD (TrustToken, 198 Mio US$)
* Gemini Dollar (65 Mio US$)
* PAXOS, JPM Coin (JP Morgan), ...

</div>

<div class="col">

![](./fiat_backed_stable_coins.png)

</div>

</div>

## The Risks

- Risk #1: Irrational market <span style="color: orange;">ðŸ™ƒ</span>
    - COIN < USD:
        - Arbitrage opportunity because of IOU redemption (Redeemability)
    - COIN > USD:
        - Arbitrage opportunity as long as you can buy/mint

- Risk #2: Counter Party / Collateral <span style="color: orange;">ðŸ˜•</span>
    - Blind trust, or
    - Periodic audits to prove solvency of the IOU company

##

<small>March 14, 2019</small>

![](tether.png){ .plain width=60% }

## Audits

- Third party audits a remedy?
- Tether: 2017 no audits, 2018 claims to have been audited by sketchy firms
- TrueUSD: Monthly audit by Cohen & Company, a top 50 U.S. public accounting firm
- Trust is deligated. Meh.

##

<p>Is there a better way?</p>

- ERC20 Token
- pegged to USD
- launched Dec 2017

## Idea

Provide stability by

- Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs),
- autonomous feedback mechanisms, and
- appropriately incentivized external actors.

##

Sounds fancy, how does it work?

## CDP

- Smart contract (think verifiable vending machine)
- Automated way to create and repay loans
- A smart contract can only operate on data that is on the blockchain

## Most important slide

|            | Paid in   | Collateral   |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------ |
| Bank loan  | Euro      | Your house   |
| CDP        | Dai       | Ether        |

##

Can we deal with the risks in a decentralized manner?

## Dealing with the risks

- Risk #1: Irrational market <span style="color: orange;">ðŸ™ƒ</span>
    - NOT redeemable!
    - Arbitrage (Keeper bots)
    - Dai < USD:
        - System incentives repayment of CDPs
    - Dai > USD:
        - System incentives creation of CDPs

<p class="fragment">â†’ Basically supply is controlled by incentives</p>

## Dealing with the risks

- Risk #2: Counter Party / Collateral <span style="color: orange;">ðŸ˜•</span>

    - On-chain "staking" of collateral
    - Always over-collateralized ("Secure debt"), because of volatile nature of the asset

## How much Dai can I draw?

![](./cdp.svg){ .plain width=20% }

- The amount of Dai depends on the price of ETH
- The ratio is called "collateralization ratio"
- Must be higher than the "liquidation ratio" (150%)

## If Ether goes up

![](./cdp_collateral_up.svg){ .plain width=40% }

- Not a problem, collateralization ratio goes up
- Dai gets stronger as there is more collateral
- Payback amount in Dai does not change

##

![](./cdp_margin_long.svg){ .plain width=40% }

Use Dai to buy more of the collateral asset.

<p class="fragment">â†’ Decentralized margin long</p>

## If Ether goes down

![](./cdp_collateral_down.svg){ .plain width=20% }

- May become a problem: A CDP can become "under-collateralized".
- Forced liquidation when hitting liquidation ratio (Margin call)

## Liquidation

![](./cdp_liquidation.svg){ .plain width=20% }

- Auctions part the your collateral to the highest bidder
- Adds a penalty (13% of borrowed assets) to incentivize high collateralization ratios

## Returning your Dai

![](./cdp_close.svg){ .plain width=20% }

- If you want to access your collateral, you have to close repay the borrowed Dai.
- Pay stability fees in relation to the holding period

##

All is good!

## Is it?

![](./black_swan.jpg){ .plain }

---

## Governance

##

- Who sets the collateralization ratio?
- Who sets the stability fee?
- Who white-lists the oracle price feeds?
- Who decides which tokens can be used as collateral?

<p class="fragment">â†’ MKR holders</p>

## MKR Token

- Governance (https://vote.makerdao.com/)
- Insurance against black swan events
- Receive a compensation
- Basic idea: "Share risk and profit"

## Global settlement

- Last resort shutdown
- Everyone can claim the net value of the collateral they are entitled to
- Can be triggered by whitelisted MKR holders

## Stability Fees

- Stability fees are collected in MKR and send to a burner contract
- By shrinking supply, MKR holders are rewarded for taking on the involved risks

## Community

- Friendly community
- Weekly Community Calls / Governance Calls

> "We are dedicated to providing material for new people to understand the system
> in depth. This will be important for successful governance in the project's
> future."

## Discussion

##

1. Use cases and related projects
2. Risks and criticism
3. Future developments
4. Wrap up / The big picture

## Use cases and related projects

- Ether on margin
- Decentralized bank [InstaDApp](https://instadapp.io/)
- Real estate investing [FACTOR-805](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwolfson/2019/02/20/stablecoins-could-unleash-wall-street-adoption-of-blockchain-technology/#617f3ea2453c)
- [Compound Finance](https://compound.finance/) - Pool assets and receive interest, supports Dai

## xDai Chain

- Ethereum side chain built by POA Network
- Proof of Authority, [5 second block time](https://blockscout.com/poa/dai)
- XDai native token (representation of Dai)
- Locking ERC20 tokens on Mainnet will mint those on side chain
- [xdai.io Burner Wallet](https://xdai.io/)
- Powered food trucks on ETHDenver 2019 (~35k USD turnover)

## Criticism 1/2

- Deflation risk of the collateral ("CDPs swallowing ETH")
- Failure of governance
- Regulatory uncertainty
    - Who fights the legal wars? InstaDApp or MakerDAO?
    - Taxes?

## Criticism 2/2

- [Inability to scale to a global stable currency?](https://medium.com/reserve-currency/our-analysis-of-the-makerdao-protocol-4a9872c1a824)
    - Might not be able to meet demand, while keeping over-collateralization
- Price Wars with non-decentralized projects
    - Tether could clone the system and offer 0 % loans
    - Leverage up to 1.67 % / BitMEX up to 100%

## Alternatives

- Algorithmic Supply Stablecoins
- Metal-backed Stablecoins (DigixDAO)
- [Other](https://stablecoinindex.com/projects)

## Future developments

## Multi-Collateral Dai

<div class="container">

<div class="col">

![](./cdp_multi_collateral.svg){ .plain width=70% }

</div>

<div class="col">

More stability and scalability through diversification

- ERC20
- BTC
- Tokenized Bonds/Stocks/Art

# - Take synthetic assets as collateral
#    - Let's go full circle
#    - Margin Long -->

</div>

## The Big Picture

## Triffin Dilemma

- National currency as world reserve currency
    - Controlling supply and demand of own economy
    - vs. providing enough supply for the world
- This dilemma killed the gold standard of USD

##

If you squint, MakerDAO looks alot like a central bank.

## Yea, but...

- A *sound*, *transparent*, *non-fractional-reserve* bank
- Supranational: Not bound to any specific economy
- Restricted by design: Code-as-law

##

To overcome the Triffin dilemma, we need a *stable* currency which is *governed globally* and *independent of any specific state or economic area*.

Sound familiar?

## Bonus slides

## Oracles

- "The smart contract needs to know the price of ETH"
- "A smart contract can only operate on data that is on the blockchain"
- Oracles to the rescue: The median value is chosen from multiple Oracle price feeds.

## Oracle contracts

* Invididually owned [Price feed contracts](https://github.com/makerdao/price-feed) will
  be called periodically and store the value.
* Then they ``poke`` the [Medianizer contract](https://github.com/makerdao/medianizer)
* On each poke, the medianizer calculates and stores the median price of all feeds.
* Governance can whitelist certain price feed contracts.

## The cool thing is

...other contracts can call ``read`` on the [Medianizer](https://github.com/makerdao/medianizer/blob/master/src/medianizer.sol#L87).

Other Dapps like Compound, Gnosis and Augur are using it.

## Room for improvement

* *n* price feeds means *n times the gas* every update.
* Possible mitigation (Oracles V2) is to instead of calling a store and poke
  function on-chain, sign+send a message to a relayer who will then post it on-chain


## ETH, WETH and PETH

ETH â†’ WETH â†’ PETH â†’ Dai

- WETH: Wrapped ETH (ERC20 representation of Ether)
- PETH: Pooled ETH

## Short technical dive

- ``open`` -- initialize CDP
- ``lock`` -- lock up collateral
- ``draw`` -- issue Dai
- ``free`` -- reclaim collateral
- ``wipe`` -- send back Dai (reduce issuance)
- ``shut`` -- close CDP
- ``give`` -- transfer CDP to another owner
- ``bite`` -- trigger liquidation / apply penalty
- ``grab`` -- receive CDP's collateral while in liquidation
